#### <font size = 4>*All Your Work in One Place*</font>
<font class = "yourtab-body">Apollo is your personal work space within Shuttle where you can save your code and modules. Use Apollo to switch between projects, connect projects to one another, and manage your code in a Git repository.</font>

#### <font size = 4>*Always Building*</font>
<font class = "yourtab-body">Having all your work in one spot means you can come back to it any time. This is a great way to track your progress and keep you motivated to build more. It also allows you to take your existing projects to the next level any time, or connect them with overlapping projects.

#### <font size = 4>*Interactive Applications*</font>
<font class = "yourtab-body">Most people learn how to code because they want to build something cool and have fun with new skills. Like learning any new skill it can be hard and, at times, no fun at all. One way around this is to build something exciting from the get go, and focus on solving problems within it. Using the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">Shiny package</a>, you get to build your own custom, interactive apps from day one.  You can use the applications you create for work, or just to mess around with in your free time.</font>
